Hi, I'm Johnnie Yu, a twenty-something year old consumer investor and self-proclaimed brand nerd and futurist, currently living and working in New York City. I invest at [Listen](https://listen.co/?utm_source=johnnie) by day and sometimes [make things](https://notnotjohnnie.com/?utm_source=johnnie) by night.

My (investing-related) interests are in brands that operate at the intersection of consumer and culture, especially ones that participate in category creation and operate in the counter-culture. I also run a [web development + design agency](https://pragmaticdlt.com) specializing in AI, and mentor brands through [NYU](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/centers/berkley-center-for-entrepreneurship) and [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/).

Outside of investing, you can find my alter ego in my home studio. I print in my darkroom (read: repurposed bathroom) and sometimes draw and screen print. I love photographing friends and collaborating with emerging artists and fashion brands. I also enjoy cooking and hosting dinner parties with friends.
